# Elevator-8051
Here, we design a simple elevator simulator that mimics the movement of the elevator when responding to requests from various floors. 

* We assume a building of 5 floors including the ground floor. Inside the elevator kart, we have 5 buttons, one for each floor. In each floor, we have 2 buttons either requesting the client wants to go up or down.

* If the elevator moves to a floor responding to going up request, it won't stop for any going down request until the going up request is done. And vice versa.

* Our system keeps track of all requests and responds to all of them in a logical manner and order.

* Our system includes 7-segment, Push buttons, LEDs, DC motors, and interrupts.
